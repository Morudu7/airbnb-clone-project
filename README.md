## UI/UX Design
### Design Goals
The primary design goals for the application are:
-Create an intuitive booking flow with minimal friction.
-Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components.
-Ensure fast loading times for an optimal user experience.
-Prioritize a mobile-first approach to ensure full responsiveness.

### Key Features
-Property search and filtering functionality.
-Detailed property viewing with high-quality images.
-Secure and streamlined checkout process.
-User authentication (sign-up, login).

### Primary Pages
The application will focus on the following three main views:

| Page | Describtion 
| ---- | ---- |
| Property Listing View | A grid display of all available properties with robust filters. |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property information including a photo gallery, host details, amenities list, user reviews, and an interactive booking form/calendar. |
| Simple Checkout View  | A streamlined interface for payment processing and booking confirmation. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is critical for success. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design reduce friction in the user journey, which directly increases conversion rates and improves overall customer satisfaction. Accessibility (WCAG guidelines) will also be prioritized.
