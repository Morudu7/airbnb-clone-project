# AIRBNB-CLONE PROJECT
 ## üéØ Project Overview
 This project is a front-end clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB.</br>
 The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to: 
 1. Browse property listings.
 2. View detailed property information. 
 3. Complete bookings.

The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design

## üé® UI/UX Design Planning
### Design Goals
The primary design goals for the application are:
- Create an intuitive booking flow with minimal friction.
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components.
- Ensure fast loading times for an optimal user experience.
- Prioritize a mobile-first approach to ensure full responsiveness.

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering functionality.
- Detailed property viewing with high-quality images.
- Secure and streamlined checkout process.
- User authentication (sign-up, login).

### Primary Pages
The application will focus on the following three main views:

| Page | Description 
| ---- | ---- |
| Property Listing View | A grid display of all available properties with robust filters. |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property information including a photo gallery, host details, amenities list, user reviews, and an interactive booking form/calendar. |
| Simple Checkout View  | A streamlined interface for payment processing and booking confirmation. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is critical for success. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design reduce friction in the user journey, which directly increases conversion rates and improves overall customer satisfaction. Accessibility (WCAG guidelines) will also be prioritized.

## Figma Design Specifications
### Color Styles
- Primary Accent: #FF5A5F (Used for key actions like booking buttons and active links)
- Secondary Accent: #008489
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text: #222222 (Primary content)
- Secondary Text: #717171

### Typography
- Primary Font Family: Circular
- Primary Text: Medium (500), 16px
- Headings: Bold (700), 24px - 32px
- Secondary Text/Captions: Book (400), 14px

### The Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying these specific design properties (colors, fonts, sizes) upfront is crucial. It ensures visual consistency across all components, allows developers to accurately translate the design into code, and significantly speeds up the development process by defining a clear design system.

## üß© UI Component Patterns

To maximize reusability and maintain consistency, the frontend will be built using a component-based architecture.

### Planned Components
1. Navbar</br>
   -The main navigation component at the top of the page. It will contain the Logo, a primary Search Bar, User Navigation links (e.g., Host a Home, Sign In/Up), and a Responsive Menu toggle for mobile views.

2. Property Card</br>
   -A reusable card component dedicated to displaying a single listing in the listing view. Contents include a high-resolution Property Image, basic property Details (price, location, rating), and a Favorite Button. Designed for a responsive grid layout.

3. Footer</br>
   -The bottom section of the application providing secondary information. It will include Site Links (e.g., About Us, Help), Company Information, Social Media Links, and the necessary Copyright Information.

Each component will be designed to be stateless where possible and easily adaptable to different data inputs.
